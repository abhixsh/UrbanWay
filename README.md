# About UrbanWay

- Book Cab is a web app that optimizes the rideshare booking approach. This app serves as a single source to help users find the shortest path for multiple destination, shared rides.

- The goal of this project is to figure out the shortest feasible path from a given starting point using an algorithm. The performance of the developed algorithm will be studied for practical use.


# How it Works
- Works on Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute shortest and optimized  path by considering each location as a vertex of the graph.
- The booking is then paired with max 4 people based on the route and low cost.

### What is Bellman-Ford Algorithm 
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
