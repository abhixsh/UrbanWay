## Introduction

Our project is to build a website for Bus/Train passengers to book their seats easily by tapping at their fingertips. The project aims to create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the ticket booking process and enhances the overall travel experience for users.

This website allows users to book their bus tickets, and train tickets, view bus and train schedules, check bus seat availability, buy tickets, view routes, search bus & train availability by source, and destination stops, view available buses and trains, sort & filter buses based on amenities, dropping and boarding points, fare, time, seats available. Users can access the website without creating an account but when booking tickets it will ask for the mobile number and a name. After entering those, users will get an OTP(One-time password) which allows the website to verify the user.
